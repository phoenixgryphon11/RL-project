# RL-project
   
We attempted to create agents to play and complete the Minihack-Quest-Hard-v0 environment, with the key investigation being the effect of reward-shaping on fairly standard RL algorithm implementations.

* Agent 1 was designed using a DQN value function method
  * this agent runs from python files executed from the terminal 
* Agent 1 was designed using a A2C policy method
  * this agent runs from a jupyter notebook

For both agents we apply custom reward shaping.
